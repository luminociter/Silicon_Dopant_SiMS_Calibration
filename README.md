# Silicon_Dopant_SiMS_Calibration
Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy and Process simulation Study of Phosphorus and Boron implantation under different energies, oxide thickness and diffusion models

The attached files include comparison between SiMS measurements and Process simulation using SYNOPSYS TCAD. Implantation is simulated using complete MC model with full cascade damage calculation via the CRYSTAL TRIM algorithm while diffusion is modeled with the charged pair model.
One set of measurements corresponds to high resistivity substrate and a second to low resistivity n type substrate, both implanted with phosphorus. 
A set of measurements is included after proton radiation to a fluence of 1e16 neq/cm2 at KIT in Karlsruhe and no discernable differences are observed between the irradiated and unirradiated profiles.
